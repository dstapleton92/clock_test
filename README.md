# Clock Test

### Purprose
To definitively determine how many times per day a clock is right if it ticks backwards. Assume the clock moves at a rate of 1 second / second, only in the backwards direction. The mechanics of the clock remain the same. After the second hand moves backwards an entire rotation, the minute hand will move backwards 1 position, etc.

### Usage
The example is written in TypeScript. You can compile it using:
```
tsc clocktest.ts
```
You can easily run it from Terminal using:
#### (note the .js extension when running in Node)
```
node clocktest.js
```
